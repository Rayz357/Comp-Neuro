# W3D1: Bayesian Decision
## Tutorial 1: Bayes with a binary hidden state  
## Tutorial 2: Bayesian inference and decisions with continuous hidden state
### Summary
In this tutorial, you extended your exploration of Bayes Rule and the Bayesian approach in the context of finding and choosing a location for Astrocat.

Specifically, we covered:

The Gaussian distribution and its properties

That the likelihood is the probability of the measurement given some hidden state

Information shared between Gaussians (via multiplication of PDFs and via two-dimensional distributions)

That how the prior and likelihood interact to create the posterior, the probability of the hidden state given a measurement, depends on how they covary

That utility is the gain from each action and state pair, and the expected utility for an action is the sum of the utility for all state pairs, weighted by the probability of that state happening. You can then choose the action with highest expected utility.
