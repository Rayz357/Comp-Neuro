# Tutorial 1: Geometric view of data 
- In this tutorial, we learned that multivariate data can be visualized as a cloud of points in a high-dimensional vector space. The geometry of this cloud is shaped by the covariance matrix.
- Multivariate data can be represented in a new orthonormal basis using the dot product. These new basis vectors correspond to specific mixtures of the original variables - for example, in neuroscience, they could represent different ratios of activation  across a population of neurons.
- The projected data (after transforming into the new basis) will generally have a different geometry from the original data. In particular, taking basis vectors that are aligned with the spread of cloud of points decorrelates the data.
* These concepts - covariance, projections, and orthonormal bases - are key for understanding PCA, which will be our focus in the next tutorial.
